This project is being created for Healthcare Information Systems
Security Course at Capitol Technology University. The project will
contain a env file containing environment variables, a read me with
project description and execution instrutions, and a .py file to execute.
The project will take a sample xlsx containing person healthcare information (fake)
and implement three confidentiality and three integrity controls.

For confidentiality, I will anonymize the data in the sample file, encrypt
it using pycrypto, and contain the salt and passphrase for encryption within
an environment file. This will make it difficult to sniff the data through network
traffic. The anonimization of data will also make it useless to individuals who are
attempting to steal personal identifiable information. Containing the salt and
passwords for encryption in an environment file is a software development
best practice to prevent leaving sensitive information in plaintext for potential
attackers.

To maintain integrity, I have used a version controller (GitHub) to manage who
has access to read and modify the data/code within this project. Two-factor
authentication will also be used in combination with Google Authenticator to
ensure only authorized individuals can execute the program. The last integrity
control will be input validation. When entering your code for TFA, I will ensure
that users can only enter a code of proper length and type. This will prevent
buffer overflow attacks from taking place. I may also implement a function to ask
users for a specified file path where they would like the decrypted file to be sent.
If this is implemented, input validation will also take place on that variable.
