This project is being created for Healthcare Information Systems
Security Course at Capitol Technology University. The project will
contain a env file containing environment variables, a read me with
project description and execution instrutions, and a .py file to execute.
The project will take a sample xlsx containing person healthcare information (fake)
and implement three confidentiality and three integrity controls.

For confidentiality, I will anonymize the data in the sample file, encrypt
it using pycrypto, and contain the salt and passphrase for encryption within
an evironment file.

To maintain integrity, I have used a version controller (GitHub) to manage who
has access to read and modify the data/code within this project. Two factor
authentication will also be used in combination with Google Authenticator to
ensure only authorized individuals can execute the program.
